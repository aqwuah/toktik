## FAQ

#### How do you get a TikTok data export?

You can obtain your TikTok data export by going to the app, going to your profile, clicking the hamburger icon (‚ò∞), clicking **Settings and Privacy** -> **Account** -> **Download your data** and then selecting **`JSON`** as the file format. Wait a couple days for the data to be processed and then download it from the same location within the app.

#### Can I do this for multiple people?

Yes, you can instantiate multiple objects with different data files and perform analysis on each of them.

#### Does this store any sensitive data?

No, this program is run client-side and stores no data. For confirmation, the code is made open source and readily available to view.


#### What does a **`InvalidDataFile`** error mean?

An `InvalidDataFile` exception is thrown for many reasons, including: an invalid argument provided, an empty file, an invalid file path, an invalid file type or a file that is missing data. Ensure that you fix the following issues before running the code again. 


## Usage

```py
from toktik import TokTik

user = TokTik("user_data.json")

comments = user.comments()
username = user.username()
videos = user.videos()
likes = user.likes()

print(f"{username} has commented {comments} times.")
print(f"{username} watched {videos['count']} videos in the last {videos['days']} days.")
print(f"Thats an average of {round(videos['count'] / videos['days'])} videos a day.")

print(f"You like {round(likes['count'] / videos['count'] * 100)}% of the videos you watch.")
```
## Example

`main.py`

```py
from toktik import InvalidDataFile, generate_stats_file

file_path = input("JSON File: ").strip()

try:
    stats_file = generate_stats_file(file_path)
except InvalidDataFile:
    print("The provided file was not valid.")
```
